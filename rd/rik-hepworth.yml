  ## Bio
  I have been a Director of [Black Marble](https://www.blackmarble.com), a leading software company in the north of England for over ten years. Throughout my career I’ve worked with a broad range of vendors and equipment, usually getting them to work well together. I now run Black Marble’s Consultancy business, where my team and I are responsible for helping our customers’ IT activities drive business value.
  
  My key areas of focus are Cloud and DevOps, and I work with customers in areas such as application modernisation, integration, improving development and delivery processes, and cloud governance. One of the great joys of my current role is that I get to engage with customers at many levels, from C-suite executives to individual developers and IT pros, learning about their work and goals and helping them to achieve more through better use of technology.
  
  I am a Chartered IT Professional and member of the British Computing Society. I care about the level of professionalism in our industry and how we engage with our customers as practitioners. 
  
  As a proud supporter of our great technology community, I am involved with the organisation of the [DDD North]( https://www.dddnorth.co.uk/) and [Reading]( http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/) community conferences and you will find me speaking at conferences and user groups throughout the year, both in person and online. I am also proud to be a member of the Admin Team for the Global Azure community event.
  
  Since 2014, I have been a member of the [Microsoft MVP Award]( https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001139?fullName=Rik%20Hepworth) programme for my community activities focused on the Azure public cloud.
  
  I’ve been in the industry for a long time now and worked with a broad range of technologies and platforms. If you see me at an event please introduce yourself – I’ll happily engage in conversation on anything from coax cabling to cloud, but especially community and Lego!
